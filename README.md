# Northumbrian Piping Resources

For license see [LICENCE.md](LICENCE.md).
The essence of this is that this is freely available for more or less anything.

I like being given credit for artwork, but my intention is that this is 
a freely usable resource for anyone who wants to talk or write about
Northumbrian pipes.

Feel free to send me a message by creating an issue here, or by getting in
touch through the Northumbrian Pipers Newsgroup.
